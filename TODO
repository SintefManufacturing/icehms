Holon should not inherit Logger but instanciate one. carefull this might brake a lot of code
AgentManager could then use the same logger class


use isinstance to automatically detect agents and holons in agentmanager


can we implement thread safe iterator : for i in self.mailbox ??


when externaly calling stop holons need to close all other thread and de-register
if in standalone mode then we should shutdown factory


cleanup the getAdmin and getSession in icemanager !!!
